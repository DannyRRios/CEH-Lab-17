This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
For this lab it was all about hacking an android device. We first hacked an Android device by creating binary payloads. We then got a userâ€™s credentials using Social Engineer Toolkit. I was then tasked to launch a DOS attack from an android device using LOIC. I then exploited the Android platform through ADB using PhoneSploit and lastly for the Red portion of the lab I hacked an Android device by creating APK file using AndroRAT. I then used Android analyzers to be able to analyze files that are downloaded on the android. Finalizing the lab I then secured the device from malicious apps using Malwarebytes Security.

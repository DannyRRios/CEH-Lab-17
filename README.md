This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
For this lab it was all about hacking an android device. I first hacked an Android device by creating binary payloads. I then got a userâ€™s credentials using Social Engineer Toolkit. I was then tasked to launch a DOS attack from an android device using LOIC. I then exploited the Android platform through ADB using PhoneSploit and lastly for the Red portion of the lab,I hacked an Android device by creating APK file using AndroRAT. Finalizing the lab, I then secured the device from malicious apps using Malwarebytes Security.
